// blockchain = chronological, sequential list of blocks 
/* Blockchain contains:
Index: location of the block within the blockchain 
Payload: data inside the block
Timestamp: time within the blockchain 
Nonce: special number used in mining (POW)
Previous block hash: cryptographic fingerprint of the previous block 
Hash: cryptographic fingerprint of all the data above put together*/

//Hashing - a hash algorithm is a set of irreversible computations that can be performed on a data to generate a unique byte sequence
